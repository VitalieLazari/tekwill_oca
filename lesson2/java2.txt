Java is object-oriented language 
Java is platform-independent
.java (source code) - javac (source code is compiled) - .class (result bytecode) - java (class file executed by JRE)

java benefits modularity, information hiding, maintaining, code reuse

create a "hello" simple class save as .java
in comand line write javac [name of file which is equal to class name].java a .class will be created
to run in command line write java [name of java class] and the mentioned class will be executed
